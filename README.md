## Introduction

This project aims to provide an easy way to download videos from Coursera.

Not all extensions will need of all scripts or all types of messaging. All code snippets are optional. Text and images should be replaced with your own.

## Installation

.

## Development

To run a development server that will watch for file changes and rebuild the scripts, run:

```
yarn start
```

To just build the files without the development server:

```
yarn build
```

Both commands will create a `dist/` directory, it will contain the built files that should be loaded into the browser or packed.
