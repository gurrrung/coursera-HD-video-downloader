<h1 align="center">Coursera HD Video Downloader</h1>

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an easy way to download videos from Coursera in most highest quality available.

## Installation

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursera-hd-video-downloa/kpnmpopgchfdpjephjkcgikfjnbpoahf)

## Development

To run a development server that will watch for file changes and rebuild the scripts, run:

```
yarn start
```

To just build the files without the development server:

```
yarn build
```

Both commands will create a `dist/` directory, it will contain the built files that should be loaded into the browser or packed.
